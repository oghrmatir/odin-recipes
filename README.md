## About

## Motivation
> This was my first foray into web development and I found it quite interesting. This project is meant to test my HTML and CSS chops. I learned quite a lot of technologies prior to this - how to ask for help in coding forums, the basics of command line, the basics of git, and the foundations of HTML and CSS.

> Update: I came back to style the website with CSS to change its look and feel. I learned the following - the foundations of CSS, the CSS cascade, how to inspect HTML and CSS, and the different types of box model.

[^2]: The [TOP Strategy guide](https://dev.to/theodinproject/becoming-a-top-success-story-mindset-3dp2) makes it clear to [focus on the point of the assignment](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Focus%20on%20the%20point%20of%20the%20assignment) and that [foundations isn't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Foundations%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20strong%20portfolio%20generator) so no point in wasting too much time here.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>A cinnamon roll (also known as cinnamon bun, cinnamon swirl, cinnamon scroll, cinnamon Danish and cinnamon snail) is a sweet roll commonly served in Northern Europe (mainly in Nordic countries, but also in Austria, Estonia, The Netherlands and Germany) and North America.</strong></p>
    <p><em>A cinnamon roll consists of a rolled sheet of yeast-leavened dough onto which a cinnamon and sugar mixture (and brown sugar, raisins or other ingredients in some cases) is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut into individual portions and baked. The deep fried version is cinnamon roll or cinnamon bun doughnut. Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide a robust and sweet flavor.</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
      <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1/3 (3.4 ounce) package vanilla pudding mix</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup chopped pecans (Optional)</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the dough: Place milk, water, melted butter, egg, bread flour, pudding mix, sugar, salt, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed, or follow the order recommended by the manufacturer if different. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.</li>
      <li>When the dough is almost finished, start the filling: Mix brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well combined. Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
      <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 17x10-inch rectangle. Spread 1/2 cup softened butter over the rectangle, then sprinkle brown sugar mixture over top.</li>
      <li>Beginning with the long side, roll dough over filling into a log; cut log into sixteen 1-inch slices. Place slices, cut-sides up, into the prepared pan. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the rolls are cooling, make the frosting: Stir confectioners' sugar, softened butter, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla together in a bowl until well combined. Spread over warm rolls.</li>
    </ol>

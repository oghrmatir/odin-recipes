    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>A casserole (French: diminutive of casse, from Proven√ßal cassa, meaning 'saucepan') is a kind of large, deep pan or bowl used for cooking a variety of dishes in the oven; it is also a category of foods cooked in such a vessel</strong>. To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a "casserole dish" or "casserole pan", whereas the food is simply "a casserole". The same pan is often used both for cooking and for serving.</p>
    <p><em>Baked dishes have existed for thousands of years. Early casserole recipes consisted of rice that was pounded, pressed, and filled with a savoury mixture of meats such as chicken or sweetbread. Cooking in earthenware containers has always been common in most cultures, but the idea of casserole cooking as a one-dish meal became popular in the United States in the twentieth century, especially in the 1950s when new forms of lightweight metal and glass cookware appeared on the market.</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
      <li>2/3 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
      <li>4 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir onions into the pan; cook and stir until very soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar. Transfer to a small bowl, and reserve.</li>
      <li>In the same skillet, melt 2 more tablespoons butter. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until flour smells like baked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, then whisk in nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, 3 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.</li>
      <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in clean skillet; stir in panko until all crumbs are coated; reserve.</li>
      <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat, and boil beans until bright green and crisp but not raw tasting, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain very well.</li>
      <li>Spoon half of the caramelized onions into the prepared casserole dish; top with green beans. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread reserved white sauce over the green beans; sprinkle with half of the Gruyere cheese. Top with the rest of the onions, and use the back of a spoon to push onions down into sauce and cheese. Top with the buttered panko crumbs, the remaining Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot throughout and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
